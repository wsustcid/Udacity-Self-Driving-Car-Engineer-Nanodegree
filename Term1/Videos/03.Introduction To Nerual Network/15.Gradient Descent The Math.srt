1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:05,030
Now we know how to get an output from a
simple neural network like the one shown

2
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:05,910
here.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,690
We'd like to use the output to make
predictions, but how do we build this

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,030
network to make predictions without
knowing the correct weights before hand?

5
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:17,530
What we can is present it with
data that we know to be true

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,640
then set the model parameters,
the weights to match that data.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,330
First we need some measure of
how bad our predictions are.

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,500
The obvious choice is to use
the difference between the true target

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,220
value, y, and the network output, y hat.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,090
However, if the prediction is too high,
this error will be negative and

11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,270
if their prediction is too low by the
same amount the error will be positive.

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,370
We'd rather treat these
errors the same to

13
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,890
make both cases positive
we'll just square the error.

14
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,630
You might be wondering why not
just take the absolute value.

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,250
One bit of using the square
is that it penalizes

16
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,020
outliers more than small errors.

17
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,690
Also squaring the error
makes the math nice later.

18
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,455
This is the error for
just one prediction though.

19
00:01:02,455 --> 00:01:06,860
We'd rather like to know the error for
the entire dataset.

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,000
So we'll just sum up the errors for each
data record denoted by the sum over mu,

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,230
this u looking guy here.

22
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:20,190
Now we have the total error for
the network over the entire dataset.

23
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,990
And finally,

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,100
we'll add a one half in front
because it cleans up the math later.

25
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,010
This formulation is typically called
the sum of the squared errors.

26
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:34,550
SSE for short because well it is
the sum of the squared errors.

27
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,910
Remember that y hat is the linear
combination of the weights and

28
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,780
inputs passed through
that activation function.

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,240
We can substitute it in here,
then we see that the error depends on

30
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,500
the weights, wi, and
the input values, xi.

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,850
As I said before the data records
are represented by the Greek letter mu.

32
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,360
You can think of the data as two
tables or arrays, or matrices,

33
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,180
whatever works for you.

34
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,360
One contains the input data, x, and
the other contains the targets, y.

35
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,940
Each record is one row here, so
mu equals 1 is the first row.

36
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,160
Then, to calculate the total error,

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,590
you're just scanning through the rows of
these arrays and calculating the SSE.

38
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,440
Then summing up all of those results.

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,800
The SSE is a measure of
our network's performance.

40
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,540
If it's high,
the network is making bad predictions.

41
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,800
If it's low,
the network is making good predictions.

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,700
So we want to make it
as small as possible.

43
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:35,220
Going forward, let's consider a simple
example with only one data record

44
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,620
to make it easier to understand
how we'll minimize the error.

45
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,530
For the simple network the SSE is
the true target minus the prediction,

46
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,680
y- y hat and squared and divided by 2.

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,440
Substituting for the prediction, you see
the error is a function of the weights.

48
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,880
The weights are the knobs we can use
to alter the network's predictions

49
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,930
which in turn affects the overall error.

50
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,919
Then our goal is to find weights
that minimize the error.

51
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,580
Here is a simple depiction of
the error with one weight.

52
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,790
Our goals is to find the weight
at the bottom of this bowl.

53
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,340
Starting at some random weight,

54
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,130
we want to make a step in
the direction towards the minimum.

55
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:18,190
This direction is the opposite
to the gradient, the slope.

56
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:21,580
If we take many steps,
always descending down a gradient.

57
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,410
Eventually the weight will find
the minimum of the error function and

58
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,900
this is gradient descent.

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,490
We want to update the weight, so
a new weight, wi, is the old weight,

60
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,940
wi plus this weight step, delta wi.

61
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:40,070
This Greek letter, delta,
typically signifies change.

62
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:43,169
The weight step is
proportional to the gradient,

63
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:47,543
the partial derivative of the error
with respect to each weight, wi.

64
00:03:47,543 --> 00:03:51,367
We can add in an arbitrary scaling
parameter that allows us to set the size

65
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:53,780
of the gradient descent steps.

66
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,720
This is called the learning rate,
signified by the Greek letter eta.

67
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,410
Calculating the gradient here
requires multivariable calculus.

68
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,970
Which you might already know since
we're taking partial derivatives.

69
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,890
I wouldn't worry too much if you
don't understand what I'm doing here.

70
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,540
It's more important to understand
the concept of gradient descent and

71
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,380
the final result.

72
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:18,620
If you need a refresher, I suggest Khan
Academy multivariable calculus lessons,

73
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,130
which I'll link to for your convenience.

74
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,030
Writing out the gradient,
you get the partial derivative

75
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,970
with respect to the weights
of the squared error.

76
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,330
The network output, y hat,
is a function of the weights.

77
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,820
So what we have here is
a function of another function

78
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,750
that depends on the weights.

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,080
This requires using the chain
rule to calculate the derivative.

80
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,120
Here is a quick refresher
on the chain rule.

81
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,340
Say you want to take the derivative
of a function p with respect to z.

82
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,150
If p depends on another
function q that depends on z.

83
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:55,442
The chain rule says, you first take the
derivative of p with the respect to q,

84
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:58,825
then multiply it by the derivative
of q with the respect to z.

85
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:02,879
I like to envision this as
normal fractions, the d q's and

86
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,535
the denominator and numerator
cancel out, and you get back dpdz.

87
00:05:07,535 --> 00:05:11,877
This relates to our problem because
we can set q to the error,

88
00:05:11,877 --> 00:05:14,811
y- y hat and set p to the squared error.

89
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:18,842
And then we're taking
the derivative with respect to wi,

90
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:23,211
the derivative of p with respect
to q returns the error itself.

91
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:27,100
The 2 in the exponent drops down and
cancels out the 1/2.

92
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:31,140
Then we're left with the derivative
of the error with respect to wi.

93
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:36,120
The target value y doesn't depend
on the weights, but y hat does.

94
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,200
Using the Chain Rule again,
the minus sign comes out in front and

95
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,350
we're left with the partial
derivative of y hat.

96
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,650
If you remember, y hat is equal
to the activation function at h.

97
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,810
Where h is the linear combination
of the weights and input values.

98
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,520
Taking the derivative of y hat,
and again using the chain rule.

99
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,010
You get the derivative of
the activation function at h,

100
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,390
times the partial derivative
of the linear combination.

101
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:06,310
In the sum, there is only one
term that depends on each weight.

102
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,090
Writing this out for

103
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:12,410
weight one, you see that only the first
term with x1 depends on weight one.

104
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,180
Then the partial derivative of the sum
with respect to weight one is just x1.

105
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,520
All the other terms are zero,

106
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:24,860
then the partial derivative of this
sum with respect to wi is just xi.

107
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,420
Finally, putting all this together,
the gradient of the squared error

108
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,540
with respect to wi is
the negative of the error

109
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:37,410
times the derivative of the activation
function at h times the input value xi.

110
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:40,820
Then the weight step is a learning
rate eta times the error,

111
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,590
times the activation derivative,
times the input value.

112
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,730
For convenience, and to make things
easy later, we can define an error term,

113
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,250
lowercase delta, as the error times
the activation function derivative at h.

114
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,660
Then we can write our weight
update as wi equals wi

115
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,320
plus the learning rate times the error
term times xi is the value of input i.

116
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,410
You might be working with
multiple output units.

117
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,820
You can think of this as just stacking
the architecture from the single output

118
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,469
network but connecting the input
units to the new output units.

119
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:19,940
Now the total error would include
the error of each outputs sum together

120
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,030
The gradient descent step can be extended 
to a network with multiple output.

121
00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:27,148
By calculating an error term for

122
00:07:27,148 --> 00:07:30,213
each output unit denoted
with the subscript j.

123
00:07:30,213 --> 00:07:33,000
Next, I'll show you how to
translate this into codes.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,267
So you can implement gradient descent in Python and Numpy
