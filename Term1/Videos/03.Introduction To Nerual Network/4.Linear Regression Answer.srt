1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,400
Well to help us out, we can see that
these points kind of form a line.

2
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,010
And we can draw the line
that best fits this data.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,783
Now on this line, we can see that our
best guess for the price of the house is

4
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:18,499
this point here over the line,
which corresponds to $120,000.

5
00:00:18,499 --> 00:00:22,465
So if you said $120,000,
that is correct.

6
00:00:22,465 --> 00:00:24,470
This method is known
as linear regression.

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,950
You can think of linear regression as a
painter, who will look at your data and

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,299
draw the best fitting line through it.

9
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,750
Now you may be asking,
how do we find this line?

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,450
So let's try a small example.

11
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,680
Let's try to fit the best line that fits
through these three points over here.

12
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,900
Obviously best line is subjective, but
we'll find some line that works well.

13
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,710
Since we're pretending to be a computer,
we can't really eyeball the line.

14
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,470
So we're going to start by
drawing a random line and

15
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:56,030
seeing how bad this line is.

16
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,160
In order to see how bad this line is,
we calculate the error.

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,160
So we're going to look at the length of
the distances from the line to the three

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,540
points.

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,800
And we're going to say that the error
of this line is the sum of those

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,570
three lengths.

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,209
Now what we're going to do is
to move this line around and

22
00:01:16,209 --> 00:01:17,949
see if we can reduce the error.

23
00:01:17,949 --> 00:01:21,115
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:21,115 --> 00:01:23,110
So, let's say we move in this direction.

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,830
And we calculate the error again.

26
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:30,180
It’s given by these yellow distances.

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,318
We add them up and realize that
we've just increase the error, so

28
00:01:34,318 --> 00:01:35,530
that's not good.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,476
Let's try moving in
the other direction then.

30
00:01:39,476 --> 00:01:41,439
[BLANK_AUDIO]

31
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,060
We move it and
again calculate the error.

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,250
It's given by the sum
of the green distances.

33
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,240
And we see that the errors smaller,
so we say, let's take that step.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,428
If we continue doing this
procedure several times,

35
00:01:54,428 --> 00:01:56,639
we'll always be decreasing the error,
and

36
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:00,000
we'll finally arrived to a good
solution in the form of this line.

37
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,250
This general procedure to minimize
the error, is known as gradient descent.

38
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,660
In real life, since we don't want to
deal with negative distance.

39
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:13,930
What we do, is instead of finding the
distances from the line to the points,

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,030
we actually have their squares.

41
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,030
This procedure is called least squares.

42
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:23,190
So we're back here on the summit
of Mount Errorest, and

43
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:25,430
we're trying to descent to the bottom.

44
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,840
Now in this context, the higher
we are the larger our error is.

45
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,890
So descending means reducing the error.

46
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,480
Now what do we do?

47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,290
Well, we look at our surroundings and

48
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,740
try to figure out which
way we can descend more.

49
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,275
That's the equivalent of jiggling
the line around and looking for

50
00:02:43,275 --> 00:02:46,055
the movement that reduces
the error the most.

51
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:47,445
So for example here,

52
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:50,265
this seems to be the direction
that makes it descend the most.

53
00:02:51,365 --> 00:02:52,795
So we take a step in that direction.

54
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:57,280
That is the equivalent of moving
the line one step in the direction that

55
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,851
decreases the error the most.

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,650
In a way, removing the line
closer to the three points.

57
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,830
So now we've reduced our error and got
closer to the bottom of the mountain,

58
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,660
then we can start the procedure again.

59
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:13,370
Looking at our surroundings and deciding
in what direction we descend the most.

60
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,160
Or equivalently, in what direction
we get closer to the points.

61
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,024
Then we start the procedure again and
again, looking at our surroundings and

62
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:24,415
deciding in what direction we
descend the most, or equivalently,

63
00:03:24,415 --> 00:03:27,000
in what direction we get
closer to the points.

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,780
What we just did, was reducing the error
until we find its minimum value,

65
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,490
which gives us the best line fit.
